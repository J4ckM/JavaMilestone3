This is a pseudocode file.
Hopefully it'll help explain what occurs in this Project.

I found out how to do this here:

If that isn't sufficient explanation for purposes of academic integrity, I'll delete this file
and move it into the Explain method in the "game" class, as cases of System.out.println("the lines from this");


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
First things first:
The three classes with fully annotated javadoc files are:
Game, Avatar, Bat
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


What's happening here:
The Player character is the avatar, he can be moved with the a, d and space keys (left, right, jump respectively)
the s key will cause him to go down, or if walking on a platform, to stop moving
With the mouse button, the player can use a grappling hook. Left click sends out the grappling hook,
and upon the hook's contact with a Platform/Wall, the avatar is pulled towards the hook (until the avatar clicks a movement key, disengaging him)

The fruits give him powers, changing the colour of his life hearts in the top right (although red is the default and adds to his hearts unless they're 5 or greater in number)
Currently: red = default/extra heart, Blue = speedier, green = higher jump, yellow = invulnerable + fireballs
In Future: red = default/extra heart, Blue = Agile (speedier + higher jump), green = invulnerable, yellow = fireballs
They have now been given a timer, after which the powers will have worn off (until another fruit of the same type is eaten).

Fruit can be found in chests, by hitting them on the underside.
Coins (which raise your score) can also be found in chests.
What's contained within a chest is dependent on the chest's colour (brown for coins, the rest is self-explanatory).
You will know you've taken all you can from a chest when it opens.

The Spiders are the earliest encountered enemies, they move from left to right and vice versa once they bump into something.
You lose a heart by touching them, as with all enemies.
You can jump on the spider's heads to kill them (and don't lose a heart for this).
Other enemies are Bats and Wolves.
Bats fly and will hone in on you. They kill you in one hit.
Wolves are much like spiders, but larger. They can't be killed by jumping on them, they're faster, and as stated, larger.
All can be killed with fireballs.

Coloured platforms also affect the character. What they do is dependent on their colour. The colours are related to the fruit colours.
A dark coloured platform will do a negative action related to its colour. So a dark blue platform will slow you down, a dark red will cause damage.
A light coloured platform will do a positive action related to its colour. So a light blue platform will increase speed, a pink will increase health.

Platform = horizontal Platform
Wall = Vertical Platform
Box = Platform unaffected by collisions in any way (for example, hooks don't disappear upon contact with them)

Touching the flag at the end of the level will bring you to the next level.

Controls:   Since the game is a work in progress, some of these are effectively cheats.
A and D are for movement left and right. Space lets you jump and S means you descend faster.
When in Yellowstate, pressing Q and E will release fireballs to the left and the right respectively.
the M button will mute and unmute the sound.
Z zooms the screen in and unzooms

Cheat Controls:
7, 8 and 9 will cause the avatar's state to become blue, green and yellow respectively. Combinations of these can occur.
0 will cause the avatar to revert to the neutral state.
X and C will cause you to lose and gain hearts respectively.
O (the letter) will bring you to the next level (or should, it's a work in progress currently)
P will bring the player to the position (1000,1000), it's where the grappling hook is kept when not being used. Not a very important control.
